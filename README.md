This repo provides a pandoc-latex template for registering our gym sessions. The template is prepared for an arbitrary number of sessions and exercises per session.

To register a session you must modify the __data.yaml__ file with the information of your session. For each exercise you must provide: name, nยบ of series, repetitions, weight, RIR and RPE.
